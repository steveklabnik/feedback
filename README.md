# steveklabnik/feedback

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository.

---

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/steveklabnik/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/steveklabnik/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

Twitter is, by far, the easiest way to get in touch with me, especially if it's something quick. I'm [@steveklabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) on
Twitter.
